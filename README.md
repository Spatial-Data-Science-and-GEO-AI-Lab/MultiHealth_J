# MultiHealth: multi-dimensional urban and environmental exposures and inequality for health in multiple cities.

Research regarding the effect of urban and environmental exposures on health outcomes is mostly done in high-income countries because of the abundance of available data. In this project, the aim is to create multi-dimensional urban and environmental spatial indicators applicable to health research in lower income countries.
